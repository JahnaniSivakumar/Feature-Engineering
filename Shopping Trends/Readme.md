## Problem Statement 
Despite the growing popularity of online shopping, understanding and predicting customer preferences across different demographics remains a challenge. Identifying key spending behaviors, preferred categories, and payment methods is crucial for optimizing product offerings and marketing strategies to drive higher sales and customer retention.

## The story behind shopping trends: 
- While analyzing customer purchase behavior, shoppers aged 18 and above drive sales, with an average spend of $59.76 per customer.
- We expected female shoppers to lead the way, but guess what? More male customers are shopping - the ones giving the highest ratings! (“The Aha moment”)
- Footwear and clothing lead the way, with the highest average purchase amounts topping the charts.
- The top 5 colors flying off the shelves are - Olive, Yellow, Silver, Teal, and Green.
- While PayPal is the go-to choice for many, the credit card method takes the lead in total spending.

## Key Recommendations to boost sales:
- Target high-rating male shoppers while catering to female preferences for balanced growth.
- Engage female customers with personalized beauty, accessories, and fashion offers.
- Promote footwear, clothing, and popular colors (Olive, Yellow, Silver, Teal, Green) to male shoppers.
- Offer credit card discounts or loyalty points to boost repeat purchases.
- Showcase positive, high-rating male reviews to build trust and credibility.
